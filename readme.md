# Movie Guide

This is an application in which a user can input any movie they would like to know about, and the application will notify the user of details such as the movie rating, actors/actresses in the movie, director of the movie, the year of the movie and etc.


To use this application, you  must first go to https://omdbapi.com/ register an account and generate your personal API key that will be used to access the movie database. \
After you have generated your personal API key, you must insert it into the key.js file, replacing the current key.\
The application should be ready to use now.
